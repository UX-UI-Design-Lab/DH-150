## Step 01: Specify the main design challenge
The Co—Star app's purpose is to deepen users' knowledge of their own astrological identity, as well as establish and strengthen their relationships with people in their lives who share their interest in astrology. In regards to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, this purpose or activity speaks to a human's need to feel like they belong and the need to maintain and nurture one's own self-esteem. These are very broad and expansive needs, so it makes sense that there are many different approaches to this. For one, to some extent, one must believe in the ideologies behind astrology in order to be willing to partake and use an app like Co—Star. By that logic, a user on the Co—Star app can only begin to build and/or join a community on the app if they know people who share that belief. Through digital technology, a general category of limitations that this app and its users may face is in regards to accessibility. Questions of how we/Co—Star can make astrology more accessible to those with disabilities arise, but also in a less technical sense, how can we/Co—Star make astrology more accessible to people who aren't inclined to invest their time in astrology.

_How might we improve the design of the Co—Star app so it is engaging and piques the interest of those who are initially closed-off to astrology?_


## Step 02: Target users
From my personal experience, I find that younger generations tend to be more inclined to want to read or hear about astrology and what it might mean for them. As someone who is Generation Z, I feel that a lot of people in my age range and demographic aren't particularly religious, and if they are, they don't tend to be incredibly attached or committed to the ideals, traditions, and/or practices of their religion. That being said, the ideal user/candidate to interview would be someone for whom the latter description applies. 

Like institutional religions, astrology has the duality of both exercising the belief in solitude, as well as in communal settings, but more so with an emphasis on the solitude. There aren't necessarily designated commonplace buildings or spaces where people who believe or share an interest in astrology can gather on a regular basis. Therefore, users of an app like Co—Star are 'insolated' in a sense, aside from the friends they add on the app. While one can visit mediums or astrologists, doing so requires time and money. 

I chose to interview a user I know from personal experience.
