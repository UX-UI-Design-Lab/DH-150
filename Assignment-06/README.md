# DH 150 Assignment 06: Low Fidelity Protoype

Jasdy Perillo

## Brief Description

So far, I've completed my preliminary user research. Last week, I developed three user personas for three varied target users for Co—Star, an astrology app. Using these three personas, I created three scenarios that explored the following three features of the Co—Star app: adding friends, looking at astrological compatibility, and accessing one's daily horoscope. 

The purpose of this low fidelity prototype is to start thinking about how the user actually interacts with the app's interface and to gather feedback on what possible improvements in terms of design can be made or recommended to enhance the user experience.

## Wireframe Testing

**Task 1**

User is tasked with logging into their Co-Star account, navigating the app to their account settings, and turning on notifications so that they can receive a daily push notification on their smartphone device that briefly tells them about their horoscope for the day. 

Result: User successfully completed this wireflow task.

**Task 2**

User is tasked with logging into their Co—Star account, navigating the app to view their birth chart, and clicking more to find out what their 'Moon sign' is. 

Result: User selected 'Messages' and was briefly confused, but was ultimately able to successfully complete the wireflow task.

**Task 3**

User is tasked with logging into their Co-Star account, navigating the app to their account settings, and clicking the appropriate button(s)/option(s) so that they can change their Co—Star username.

Result: User successfully completed this wireflow task.

## Reflection 

This assignment was a bit tricky for me to understand. Because this prototype is low fidelity, the simplicity of the wireframe is both a blessing and a curse. On one hand, because the prototype is so minimal, the user wasn't overwhelmed with options as they 'navigated' the app; however, on the other hand, the lack of precise detail in the rudimentary nature of the low-fi prototype briefly led to a small instance of confusion during one of the tasks.

This assignment was helpful because it helps guide my thinking for how I envision my digitized, high-fidelity prototype will be. From the aesthetic assignment, I know that the Co—Star app's minimalist design is simplistic but not at all engaging, eye-catching, or memorable. Based on the feedback I received, I think the main takeaway comes from the fourth 'screen' I drew which displays the user's birth chart as it appears in the actual app. Because astrology can feel inherently confusing and convoluted, long lists can contribute to a poor user experience. Unlike a website, where users can use their mouse and cursor to hover over buttons/links/terms and read a description about their function, an app doesn't really have a hover function. I think as I move forward with this whole project, I want to think more about how I can integrate more information from the get go that anticipates users' questions about astrology (e.g. "What is a house?", "Why does your birth time matter?", etc.)
