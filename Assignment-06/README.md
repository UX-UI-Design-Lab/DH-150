# DH 150 Assignment 06: Low Fidelity Protoype

Jasdy Perillo

## Brief Description

So far, I've completed my preliminary user research. Last week, I developed three user personas for three varied target users for Co—Star, an astrology app. Using these three personas, I created three scenarios that explored the following three features of the Co—Star app: adding friends, looking at astrological compatibility, and accessing one's daily horoscope. 

The purpose of this low fidelity prototype is to start thinking about how the user actually interacts with the app's interface and to gather feedback on what possible improvements in terms of design can be made or recommended to enhance the user experience.
