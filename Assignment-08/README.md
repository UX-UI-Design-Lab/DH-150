## Brief Project Description
This quarter, I chose to look at an astrology app called Co—Star. Through user research, evaluations, and feedback, I have created a high fidelity prototype which visualizes my re-design of the app. Incorporating what I've learned and discovered in earlier weeks, I implemented changes to the app's current design to hopefully improve user experience and increase user engagement. 

## Tasks Supported by My Prototype

• Log in with username

• Forget password —> Reset new password

• Read entire birth chart

• Send a friend request

• View a friend's birth chart

• View/read about compatibility with a friend

• Make birth chart public

• Turn on notifications for:

      Daily horoscopes

      Friend request

      Friend request approved
      
• Log out

• View past/current/future horoscope (in calendar view)

## Representative Screen Designs

I chose to add four buttons to the bottom of the screen because it makes every feature that the app offers more accessible by requiring the user to click fewer times and go through fewer 'pages' to access anything (e.g. account settings). Also, because it is at the bottom, it is closer to a user's thumb/fingers. This page is essentially the home page: it's the first screen a user will see after logging into their Co—Star account. One of the most widely used features of the app is accessing one's birth chart. Unlike the current app's design, I put the user's entire birth chart on the home screen.

Originally, the current app has a scroll down list of a user's friends on the home page, but it was separate from the page where a user could enter a friend's username and send a request to add their friend on Co—Star. Because of how related these two features are, I decided to put them 'together' on one screen so that anything and everything having to do with friends on the app can be all in one place.

A brief description of your project, the purpose and process of this prototyping phase (3-5 sentences)
A list of tasks that the interactive prototype of your system supported.
One image with the representative examples of screen designs (3-5 screens) 
Description of your decision making of the graphical interface design, including the choice of the color scheme and note if you considered/checked accessibility color contrast.
One image with the wireflow with graphic design
Link to the interactive prototype or embed window that shows the prototype.
If you have multiple versions of prototypes by reflecting the evaluation with others, provide them with the description of what you learned from other’s feedback and what you have made the changes.
