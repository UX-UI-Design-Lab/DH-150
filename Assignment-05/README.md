**Relevant Demographic Information**

Grayson is a 28 year-old UX designer for a tech company in Silicon Valley. As a millennial, he loves spending his time going to speakeasies and bar-hopping, and has a soft spot for anything Disney-related. Despite growing up in a Christian household, Grayson isn't particularly attached to his religious faith, nor does he formally practice. A lot of his friends are people he went to college with, many of whom have begun to settle down.

**Motivations and Needs**

Although the majority of those in Grayson's circle are starting families, Grayson loves to travel and uses astrology to get to know those he meets—both platonic friends and romantic interests.

**Characteristics that Represent Barriers & Potential Facilitators**

Grayson feels a bit hesitant to bring up astrological and talk of horoscopes and zodiac signs with his co-workers and friends.

### Persona 3

**Relevant Demographic Information**
 
Lauren is a solo traveler. She is 24 years old. After a year and a half at NYU Steinhardt, Lauren dropped out to pursue her career in landscape photography. She now travels to capture scenic and picturesque shots of the world, with her entire life fitting inside her backpack and equipment bag. 

**Motivations and Needs**

Because she constantly travels, Lauren often feels disconnected from the day-to-day lives of her loved ones back at home on the East Coast. Since she spends so much time just trying to get from one place to another, she tries her best to be intentional and tries to dedicate time to checking in with her dad and younger brother. 

**Characteristics that Represent Barriers & Potential Facilitators**

There isn't much time for leisure, or for apps that aren't functional or fit in with her hectic lifestyle. A device like a smart watch, which integrates and merges many useful apps into one convenient interface, would be quite useful for her.

### Scenario 1

**Context/Use Case**

Persona: Ashley

Despite her bubbly personality, Ashley sometimes deals with social anxiety in certain social settings and situations. Using the Co—Star app, she quickly navigates from the home/landing page to use the 'Add Friends' feature. She uses this feature as a way of introducing herself and participating in current conversations at the social with these new people. She enters her new friends' usernames one by add and submits a pending friend request. Once approved, each person will appear in her Friends list that is located on the app's home/landing page.

### Scenario 2

**Context/Use Case**

Persona: Lauren

Because Lauren's lifestyle means living life on the go and never staying in one place, there's never seems to be enough time or resources (aka money) to sit down and learn more about astrology through online research. Lauren's scenario demonstrates using the Co—Star's primary feature: horoscopes. After creating an account and entering the appropriate information, Lauren is instantly updated on the daily on what astrology and the planets' alignments have in store for her for that particular day. It is easily accessible, as it appears on the home page and a very brief (typically one-sentence) summary of her daily horoscope appears as a push notification once a day.
