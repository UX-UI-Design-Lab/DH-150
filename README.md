## 1. Heuristic Evaluation of UCLASafeRide App by Jasdy Perillo
I chose the UCLASafeRide app because I am part of the community who uses the app—the UCLA community. I think it's important that services like UCLA Safe Ride exist because it contributes to the safety and accessibility of life at UCLA for students, faculty, staff, and more. To me, apps like UCLA Safe Ride are crucial because they contribute to the UCLA experience. For example, I can catch a van ride back to my apartment after a late night meeting on campus with my roommates or friends. I can use it to go visit Ralph's where I sometimes do my grocery shopping. This app shapes how I, and many fellow students, experience UCLA, because without it, I might not be able to attend on-campus events at night, given how far I live. The service that UCLA Safe Ride provides is integral to the UCLA community. 

## Description
The UCLASafeRide app provides a nighttime van service primarily for UCLA students. It is operated by Community Service Officers (CSOs) under the supervision of UCPD who works in partnership with UCLA Transportation to provide this van service. The app is 'active' for users to access and request a ride Monday-Friday starting at 7pm and runs until midnight. App users can select a designated stop where a van will pick them up and drop them off at another designated stop.

## 2. Heuristic Evaluation of Co — Star App by Jasdy Perillo
I chose the Co—Star app because it's a pioneer in its 'field.' Co—Star was the one of the first apps developed that did more than provide users with information about astrology and their personal birth charts. The app has a feature that lets a person add and message friends who also have an account, which allows users to compare their birth charts and daily horoscopes with those of their friends. Co—Star even provides a compatibility 'diagnostic' that analyzes a user's astrological compatibility with a friend. The Co—Star app makes astrology more accessible and its inherent design and mission is to allow users to foster and strengthen the sense of community that they share with those in their lives. I'm curious to see how the app's design accomplishes this and where the app could be improved.

## Description
The Co—Star app provides "hyper-personalized astrology" based on a person's birth chart, which can be discerned through the person's date, time, and place of birth.
