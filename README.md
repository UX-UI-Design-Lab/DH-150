## 1. Heuristic Evaluation of UCLASafeRide App by Jasdy Perillo
I chose the UCLASafeRide app because I am part of the community who uses the app—the UCLA community. I think it's important that services like UCLA Safe Ride exist because it contributes to the safety and accessibility of life at UCLA for students, faculty, staff, and more. To me, apps like UCLA Safe Ride are crucial because they contribute to the UCLA experience. For example, I can catch a van ride back to my apartment after a late night meeting on campus with my roommates or friends. I can use it to go visit Ralph's where I sometimes do my grocery shopping. This app shapes how I, and many fellow students, experience UCLA, because without it, I might not be able to attend on-campus events at night, given how far I live. The service that UCLA Safe Ride provides is integral to the UCLA community. 

## Description
The UCLASafeRide app provides a nighttime van service primarily for UCLA students. It is operated by Community Service Officers (CSOs) under the supervision of UCPD who works in partnership with UCLA Transportation to provide this van service. The app is 'active' for users to access and request a ride Monday-Friday starting at 7pm and runs until midnight. App users can select a designated stop where a van will pick them up and drop them off at another designated stop.

## Initial Overall Evaluation
From a preliminary standpoint, the app is incredibly functional and straightforward in its design. Its execution, for the most part, is sufficient, and the area where the app could probably most improve upon is the aesthetic. The design isn't 'clunky,' but it's not particularly pleasing to look at.

### #1: Visibility of system status
The UCLASafeRide app features a map that has actively tracks the location of the van designated to pick up the user. The tracking isn't the most smooth. In terms of graphic design, the movement of the van can seem choppy and not seamless.

Moreover, when app first begins to load, it has a buffering icon, which is a graphic of a red moving car.

The app provides the user with an "Average pick up time" that, again, in my own experience, has not always been the most accurate—though it is an average. Based on my numerous experiences in using the app, I have personally found that on some occasions, the ETA provided by the app for when the van should arrive can be off by several minutes. As a result, a user may not have an accurate gauge for when to expect their van to arrive. For me personally, these inaccuracies have sometimes discouraged me from using the van service entirely and resort to a different method of getting to where I need to be.

**Severity rating: 1 or 2**


### #2: Match between system and real world
The UCLASafeRide app follows a sense of natural mapping. The map has two buttons (+/-) that allow the user to zoom in and out of the map. Moreover, after the user clicks to "Request Ride," the app automatically displays two boxes at the bottom, prompting for the person's pick-up location first, and their drop-off location second. This is a good match between system and real world because naturally, the first location should be where the user would like to be picked up and the second location should be where the user would like to be dropped off.

**Severity rating: 1**

### #3: User control and freedom
After requesting a ride, the user does have the option to cancel their request. Once the user cancels their ride request, the app prompts them to enter a reason for their cancellation.

The UCLASafeRide app allows users to choose what kind of map they prefer to look at. They have options of looking at a satellite map, terrain map, a standard street map, etc.

**Severity rating: 1**

### #4: Consistency and standards
Overall, the UCLA SafeRide app maintains a consistent intuitive design. The buttons are all relatively straightforward. The only noticeable downside is that on the map, the designated stops aren't really labeled. A user must click and select the stop on a map to find out its name. In a similar sense, if a user selects their pick-up/drop-off location using the drop down menu, the map disappears. It would be helpful to users to match the geographic location with the listed name of the stop for ease when selecting where to be picked up/dropped off.

**Severity rating: 1 or 2**

### #5: Error prevention
Because the UCLASafeRide only offers the van service on certain days for a set time period, the user essentially cannot use the app outside of those designated hours. In other words, if it is not some time between 7pm-12am on a weekday (with the exception of holidays and school breaks), the app displays a dark screen that reads "Service Not Active." This prevents any user from requesting a ride outside of the van service's operating hours.

**Severity rating: 1**

### #6: Recognition rather than recall 
The app lacks a feature that would allow the user to autofill their designated pick-up and drop-off spots based on most popular or most recent trips. This option would streamline the process of requesting a ride for users who routinely use the service to go to and from the same locations on a regular basis. While users do have the option of 'starring' favorite stops as a way of making them appear at the top of the drop-down menu when selection a pick-up/drop-off location, it would be nice to have an option of autofilling both the pick-up and drop-off locations based on either a frequently made trip or on the user's ride history. Another nice option to have would be if these 'starred' stops which the user has bookmarked were also 'starred' or coded in some way on the actual map to indicate that they are the user's bookmarked stops.

On the bright side, however, a person does not routinely have to login to their MyUCLA account every time the user opens and uses the app. Instead, the person remains logged in unless the user manually clicks on the appropriate "Log out" button.

**Severity rating: 2**

### #7: Flexibility and efficiency of use
The user is able to select their designated pick-up/drop-off locations by directly clicking on the points marked on the map. The user can also zoom in and out on any part of the map by pinching in and out with their fingers.

**Severity rating: 1**

### #8: Aesthetic and minimalist design
For the most part, the UCLASafeRide app is consistent with the general branding of other UCLA related apps and UCLA in general. It uses mainly blue and yellow/gold colors in its design, which are the university's colors. The app, which is reminiscent of—if not based on— Apple's iMaps app, is relatively intuitive to navigate. It does feature landmarks on the map like certain stores, businesses, and buildings, which do help the user ascertain which are the most suitable stops for pick-up and drop-off. 

Nevertheless, in my opinion, it isn't the most appealing or eye-catching design. Its 'aesthetic' definitely does not encourage me to use the app. The visuals aren't particularly special, nor do they approach or attempt to achieve minimalism in some clever way. The font is consistent, but the app logo and its branding doesn't necessarily stand out to me. 

**Severity rating: 2**

### #9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
The app, which largely relies on the integration of live location tracking, naturally requires a good network connection from the user. If the user loses or maintains poor network connectivity, the app displays an appropriate message that asks the user to check their network connection.

**Severity rating: 1**

### #10: Help and documentation
The UCLASafeRide app only has an option to submit "Feedback," which takes the user to the Apple Mail app. Aside from this, there is an absence of any FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) page or help page. Moreover, if a user needed some sort of immediate assistance, there is no phone number listed or any system set up that could provide live online help.

## 2. Heuristic Evaluation of Co — Star App by Jasdy Perillo
I chose the Co—Star app because it's a pioneer in its 'field.' Co—Star was the one of the first apps developed that did more than provide users with information about astrology and their personal birth charts. The app has a feature that lets a person add and message friends who also have an account, which allows users to compare their birth charts and daily horoscopes with those of their friends. Co—Star even provides a compatibility 'diagnostic' that analyzes a user's astrological compatibility with a friend. The Co—Star app makes astrology more accessible and its inherent design and mission is to allow users to foster and strengthen the sense of community that they share with those in their lives. I'm curious to see how the app's design accomplishes this and where the app could be improved.

## Description
The Co—Star app provides "hyper-personalized astrology" based on a person's birth chart, which can be discerned through the person's date, time, and place of birth.

## Initial Overall Evaluation
Right off the bat, I really like the aesthetic of the Co—Star app. The app is quite word-heavy, but understandably so as that is the nature of astrology and horoscopes. I think the app tries its best to be as intuitive as possible, but if a user has absolutely zero knowledge on astrology, it's almost natural to feel overwhelmed by all the information Co—Star provides; nevertheless, I do like the way the app breaks down your birth chart, and it's definitely a lot more user-friendly than other similar apps 'on the market.' 

### #1: Visibility of system status
Right when you open the app—given that you're already logged in, Co—Star displays your horoscope and astrological update for the day. If the user wishes to look back and review

### #2: Match between system and real world

**Severity rating: **

### #3: User control and freedom 
Unfortunately, the app is currently not available for Android users, which detracts from the app's accessibility because it excludes non-iPhone users.

### #5: Error prevention
When first signing up and making an account on the app, the user will encounter these warnings if they, for example, fail to meet the requirements set by Co—Star for a username, password, etc.

### #6: Recognition rather than recall

**Severity rating: **

### #7: Flexibility and efficiency of use
The app allows the user to bookmark and save any horoscopes or astrology updates so that the user can easily peruse and access them later on. When a user would like to send a message through Co—Star to a friend, Co—Star provides a list of "suggested" friends for the user's ease.

![flexibilityandefficiencyofuse1](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=16rwWsyPT-HhohZpGdp0feQVSvQcqiMRY)

Although the app does alphabetize the user's friends list, Co—Star lacks a search bar that would allow users to simply type in a friend's name/username. Instead, the user has to manually scroll and find a specific name if they want to look at their Co—Star 'relationship' with a certain someone. 

![flexibilityandefficiencyofuse2](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1AJMWVQawU9wfcxieanR8kuUGmukl5NyW)

**Severity rating: 2**


### #8: Aesthetic and minimalist design 
Co—Star follows a relatively sleek design that is primarily grayscale, with the exception of the use of emojis which are used as indicators for different categories of a user's daily horoscope. Even the graphics follow a grayscale color palette. Certain aspects of the app may be word-heavy for some users 

**Severity rating: 1**

### #9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
There is an error message for users who have poor network connectivity. If a 'page' is loading, there is a buffering icon.

**Severity rating: 1**

![recognizediagnoserecoverfromerrors](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1-FU6CbVyQO630PRYMcost4KQTFNyg7jy)

### #10: Help and documentation
Co—Star does have a feedback form as well as a FAQ page. The feedback form also lists an e-mail that users can use to contact the app developers if they have any questions or concerns. At the bottom of the user's daily horoscope update, the app asks the user "Was this useful?" to which the user can respond by clicking one of three options: a smiley face, a frown face, or an 'indifferent' face.
